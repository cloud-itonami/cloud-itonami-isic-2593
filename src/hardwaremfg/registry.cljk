  "Pure-function domain logic for the cutlery/hand-tool/general-
  hardware shop plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch
  verification, shipment-weight recompute, product-category
  validation, defect-rate plausibility validation, and draft
  maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/hardwaremfg`-style capability library to
  wrap (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore
  lives here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `hardwaremfg.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `metalfabmfg.registry/shipment-weight-exceeded?` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2599`, the closest architectural sibling): never
  trust a proposal's own self-reported weight/status when the inputs
  needed to recompute it independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a shop coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance window, a
  coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating a forging hammer,
  grinding wheel, heat-treatment furnace or finishing line, or
  dispatching a real freight carrier (this actor NEVER does either --
  see README `What this actor does NOT do`).

  SCOPE NOTE: ISIC 2593 (this actor) is the cutlery/hand-tool/general-
  hardware shop -- a plant that forges, grinds, heat-treats and
  finishes stock into cutlery (knives/forks/spoons), hand tools
  (hammers/wrenches/screwdrivers/pliers) and general hardware (locks,
  hinges, fasteners, garden tools). This is distinct from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2591` (Forging, pressing, stamping and roll-
  forming of metal -- the primary heavy metal-forming process),
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2592` (Treatment and coating of metals), and
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2599` (Manufacture of other fabricated metal
  products n.e.c. -- the residual stamping/pressing/wire-forming shop)
  -- distinct plants with distinct hazard profiles from this one. This
  actor's own hazard profile centers on sharp-edge laceration risk from
  freshly forged/ground blades and edges (knife/tool cutting edges),
  forging-hammer pinch/crush hazard, grinding-wheel/abrasive-dust
  exposure, and heat-treatment-furnace burn/radiant-heat exposure --
  not sheet-metal stamping/pressing (2599) or heavy roll-forming/
  forging of bulk metal stock (2591).")
